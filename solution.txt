SOLUTION FOR CONSECUTIVE SUBSTRINGS

How my solution works:
I used two loops to go through the string. The first loop picks where to start and the second loop picks where to end. Then I use slice to get the substring and put it in my array.

Time complexity: O(n^2) because I have two loops that go through the string.

The main thing that makes it slower is when the string gets longer because then both loops have to do more work.
